<h1>The Best Movies According to CJ</h1>
<h2>My top-3 movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0210945/">Remember The Titans</a></h3>

<p>I love this movie because it is a true story. Also because the historical elements and the impact it provides. It is more about integrity, perserverance, and strong will than it is about football. This movie stars Denzel Washington and Will Patton as two high school coaches dealing with segregation and diversity.  </p>

<h3><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120591/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_7_nm_1_q_Armag">Armageddon</a></h3>

<p>This is a great movie for thought about the potential extinction of earth due to an impact from space with a good love story starring Ben Affleck and Bruce Willis.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120660/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">Enemy Of The State</a></h3>

<p>This is a great thriller starring Will Smith and Gene Hackman. It provides context into government corruption and how one little moment in time can turn into a vortex of trouble. </p>
